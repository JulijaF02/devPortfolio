            <h2>My quick story</h2>
            <p>I've always been drawn to building things – whether it was tree houses as a kid or tearing apart old phones just to understand how all the pieces fit together. My dad introduced me to technology early on, and I became fascinated by how things work, especially games. I'd spend hours wondering how developers made characters move and worlds come alive.</p>
            
            <p>That curiosity naturally led me to coding. The idea that I could create anything I imagined with just code was genuinely exciting. I started with a simple platformer in Stencyl, then taught myself C# in middle school. When I discovered Unity, it felt like the perfect fusion of creativity and technical problem-solving.</p>
            
            <p>I've worked in photography, video editing, and IT engineering, but software and game development is where I really found my element. There's something satisfying about working in fast-paced environments where you can take an idea from concept to a fully working product. The creative problem-solving and the ability to bring ideas to life through code – that's what keeps me motivated.</p>

          <div class="about-section">
            <h2>As a developer</h2>
            <p><strong>My coding ethos is centered on clarity and accessibility.</strong> Initially, I build to ensure functionality, but I dedicate considerable effort to refining my code - commenting, organizing, and ensuring it's welcoming to any collaborator. <em>Mi casa es tu casa</em> in the world of code.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Efficiency and maintainability are my mantras.</strong> Functional features are good, but sustainable, and adaptable code is the gold standard. It's not just about making it work; it's about crafting it to last and be easily managed.</p>
            
            <p>I thrive on new projects, as each one is a new chapter of learning and growth. <strong>Every challenge is an opportunity to expand my horizons.</strong></p>
          </div>

          <div class="about-section">
            <h2>As a person</h2>
            <p><strong>I'm naturally curious and hands-on.</strong> I don't just want to know how things work – I need to take them apart, understand the mechanics, and rebuild them. Whether it's hardware, software, or solving complex problems, I approach everything with that same exploratory mindset that had me dismantling phones as a kid.</p>
            
            <p><strong>My drive comes from possibility.</strong> When I see a challenge or envision something new, I get excited about the endless ways to approach it. That combination of technical curiosity and creative problem-solving shapes how I tackle everything, from coding to collaboration.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="about-section">
            <h2>As a colleague</h2>
            <p><strong>My collaborative spirit is a core part of who I am.</strong> With a background encompassing both engineering and the arts, I bridge gaps between the technical and creative minds in any team. Going the extra mile for my team is second nature to me.</p>
            
            <p>With a decade of experience as a teacher, my communication skills are top-notch. I excel at breaking down complex ideas into understandable segments, ensuring everyone is on the same page.</p>
            
            <p>My time at startups, and leading projects with tech giants like Facebook and Amazon, has honed my ability to balance business acumen with high-quality production. <strong>My leadership in these collaborations has been a highlight of my career.</strong></p>
            
            <p>I'm always up for making a great espresso and showing off my latte art skills. <strong>A food enthusiast at heart, I'm your go-to for the next potluck.</strong></p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 18px; color: #4bff63;"><strong>I'm eager to connect and collaborate – reach out!</strong></p>
